This repository demonstrates a common C++ error involving undefined behavior when using raw pointers with std::vector.  The `bug.cpp` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.  Modifying a vector's contents through a raw pointer obtained from `&vec[0]` is risky, especially if the vector's internal memory is reallocated. The solution uses iterators or range-based for loops to avoid this pitfall.
